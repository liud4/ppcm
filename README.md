ppcm: Predictive Partly Conditional Model
================

The $\mathtt{ppcm}$ package aims to provide user-friendly functions to
implement a predictive partly conditional model to characterize disease
progression at time $t$ with longitudinal ordinal outcomes in the
presence of time-dependent covariates at time $s$ ($s < t$) and
time-dependent effects.

## Installation

You can install the $\mathtt{ppcm}$ package from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liud4/ppcm")
```
