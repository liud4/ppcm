```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The $\mathtt{ppcm}$ package aims to provide user-friendly functions to implement 
a predictive partly conditional model to characterize disease progression at
time $t$ with longitudinal ordinal outcomes in the presence of time-dependent
covariates at time $s$ ($s < t$) and time-dependent effects.

## Installation

You can install the $\mathtt{ppcm}$ package from GitHub with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liud4/ppcm")
```
